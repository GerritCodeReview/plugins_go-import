      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I see the point of this change.\nThe benefits of standalone build is that you don\u0027t need an entire gerrit source-tree.\nBut by setting the gerrit-api to a snapshot version you need the entire gerrit source-tree to build and install the snapshot gerrit-api version.\nIt will also create a lot of extra work keeping this snapshot version up-to-date.\n\nIf the builder needs to specify which version it builds against I would suggest that we remove the stand-alone build for the plugin so that we don\u0027t have to maintain the SNAPSHOT version of the api.\nWDYT?",
