We usually strive for not staying on SNAPSHOT for too long when that applies to plugins we maintain.\n\nNow, I pushed this change again and related ones earlier this week so we could get build feedback about them plugins against the near 3.3 api.\n\n\u003e If the builder needs to specify which version it builds against I would suggest that we remove the stand-alone build for the plugin so that we don\u0027t have to maintain the SNAPSHOT version of the api.\n\u003e WDYT?\n\nI agree. Removing stand-alone has been happening for some plugins already, yes. I did it yesterday for the HA plugin from 3.3 onwards. I also think that we should continue removing the support for that bazel build mode in more plugins that we maintain.\n\nI consider this as a WIP for my share of it, as I was already planning to do it some more soon. I\u0027d be glad to review related changes as well of course. As far as all plugin X maintainers can review (to agree upon) such changes indeed.",
