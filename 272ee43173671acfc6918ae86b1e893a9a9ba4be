      "message": "I could see that being important in certain cases, but it\u0027s my understanding that the Go import system isn\u0027t designed for deployment so much as it is for ease of download/installation of packages and librariesâ€”and of course globally unique namespacing. Consider just how cumbersome it is to provide SCM credentials to the `git` commands behind `go install` and `go get` and why there\u0027s no support for it in the latter two commands of the native Go toolchain.\n\nMight it be better in scenarios that do require auth to simply clone/install repos manually, and allow for the more common case (no auth) to be served by default?",
