Meaning, as permissions are aggregated so the least permissive one gets applied, ultimately. Welcoming other reviewers comments here, about the likelihood or logical possibility of such cases.\n\nThere might be a need for a fall-back mechanism as previously proposed, where a failure being served by the anonymous URL could lead to authenticating as a second/last resort.",

I don\u0027t see how the plugin can know whether or not auth for the git clone would fail on the client side.\n\nMaybe by means of analysing the response to the (here non-auth) request? I\u0027m currently lacking time to elaborate further on this. However maybe another reviewer would be ready to comment accordingly(?)\n\nThere is also that other aspect above about other permission(s) that could anyway override the refs/heads/* one. More research on the possible counter-permissions side might help as well.",
