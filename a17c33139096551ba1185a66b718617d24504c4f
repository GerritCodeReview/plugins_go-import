Meaning, as permissions are aggregated so the least permissive one gets applied, ultimately. Welcoming other reviewers comments here, about the likelihood or logical possibility of such cases.\n\nThere might be a need for a fall-back mechanism as previously proposed, where a failure being served by the anonymous URL could lead to authenticating as a second/last resort.",
